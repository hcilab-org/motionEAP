# motionEAP

The motionEAP project aims to augment workplaces with in-situ projection to support workers during manual assembly tasks. Using a depth-sensor, motionEAP is able to deliver appropriate feedback regarding the current assembly step. Correct or wrong assembly steps as well as picks from bins are detected using image processing algorithms.
