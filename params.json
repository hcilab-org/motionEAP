  "body": "# motionEAP\r\n\r\nThe motionEAP project aims to augment workplaces with in-situ projection to support workers during manual assembly tasks. Using a depth-sensor, motionEAP is able to deliver appropriate feedback regarding the current assembly step. Correct or wrong assembly steps as well as picks from bins are detected using image processing algorithms.\r\n\r\n## Why citing motionEAP\r\n\r\nIf you are using motionEAP in your research-related documents, it is recommended that you cite motionEAP. This way, other researchers can better understand your proposed-method. Your method is more reproducible and thus gaining better credibility.\r\n\r\n## How to cite motionEAP\r\n\r\nBelow is the BibTex entry to cite motionEAP\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n@inproceedings{funk2016motioneap,\r\n author = {Funk, Markus and Kosch, Thomas and Kettner, Romina and Korn, Oliver and Schmidt, Albrecht},\r\n title = {motionEAP: An Overview of 4 Years of Combining Industrial Assembly with Augmented Reality for Industry 4.0},\r\n booktitle = {Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Knowledge Technologies and Data-driven Business},\r\n series = {i-KNOW '16},\r\n year = {2016},\r\n location = {Graz, Austria},\r\n numpages = {4},\r\n publisher = {ACM},\r\n address = {New York, NY, USA}\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n",
